**Describe**
When you say run a command like `ls`, how does it know which exe is this `ls`? Just find the file in some collection of directories and search the name in these directories. These directories are stored (separated by `:`) in the `$PATH` variable.

1. show the path dirs  
   `echo $PATH`
1. temporarily modify $PATH:
    ```
    export PATH="/Directory1:$PATH"
    ```
1. permanently modify:
   add this export statement to the `~/.bashrc`

# bg, process
1.	Show process run by yourself: 
    ```
    ps -u mqyu
    htop -u mqyu commands 
    top -u mqyu -c
    ```
    
2.	Run in background:
    `nohup python 1_predict.py > nohup_out_1.out 2>&1 &`

    already running:

    `disown -a`
    `disown -h %1`

3.	See process:
    `jobs / w`

4.	Kill
    ```
    kill -9 PID
    killall -u mqyu
    kill -2 PID     # more warmly. Like CTRL+C (SIG_INT)
    ```

5. Inspect process by PID
    ```
    ps -o user,args -p <PID>       # get the command and the user name
    ```

# Connection
1. scp and file transfer

    `scp -P <port> -r work/rna_mod/model/data/ mqyu@some.address:~`

2. see ip address
   `ifconfig`

# Compress uncompress
1. compress  
    tar -czvf [archive name].tar.gz [pathtofile]
1. uncompress 
    tar -xzvf [file .tar.gz]
    tar -xvf [file .tar]

    zip file: unzip file.zip
    bed file: gunzip [file path]

# Configuration

1. set alias
    For temporary: just eg `alias ll='ls -lah'`
    For permanent: add `alias ll='ls -lah'` in `~/.bash.rc`

# Others
1. Find
    `find . -name thisfile.txt`

1. time

    `time <normal command>`

    1. Real Time (real). The actual time it took to execute the command, from start to finish.
    1. User Time (user). The time the CPU spent on the task itself.
    1. System Time (sys). The time the CPU spent on system-level tasks related to the command.
   
1. rsync
    `rsync -chavzP --stats user@remote.host:/path/to/copy /path/to/local/storage`

1. inspect storage
   ```
   du -sh <dir or file name>
   du -h --max-depth=1 /path/to/parent/directory | sort -h
   du -sh path/* | sort -h  # storage of sub directory sorted
   du -sh .[!.]* * 2>/dev/null | sort -h
   ```

1. link
   ```
   # soft: point to the link
   ln -s [source] [link]	

   # hard: store the same inode
   ln [source] [link]

   # eg: create a file called my_link to link to an already existing file myfile.txt
   ln -s /path/to/myfile.txt /path/to/my_link
   ```
